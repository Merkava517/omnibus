[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/omnibus.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/omnibus)

Prepares a machine to be an Omnibus builder.

This project is managed by the CHEF Release Engineering team. For more information on the Release Engineering team's contribution, triage, and release process, please consult the [CHEF Release Engineering OSS Management Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/opscode.com/document/d/1oJB0vZb_3bl7_ZU2YMDBkMFdL-EWplW1BJv_FXTUOzg/edit).

Requirements
------------
This cookbook requires Chef 11.0.0+.

For a full list of supported platforms and external cookbook requirements, please see the `metadata.rb` file at the root of the cookbook.


Recipes
-------
The default recipe is the main entrypoint for the cookbook and does the following:

- Ensures all required Omnibus-related directories are created and owned by the build user.
- Ensures a sane build tool-chain is installed and configured (using the [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) cookbook)
- Ensures git is installed (using the [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) cookbook)
- Includes a platform-specific recipe to apply additional tweaks as appropriate.

All other recipes should be treated as "private" and are not meant to be used individually. They only exist to support the `default` recipe.

```ruby
omnibus_build 'harmony' do
  project\_dir 'https://github.com/chef/omnibus-harmony.git'
  log_level :internal
  config_override(
    append_timestamp: true
  )
end
```

Usage
-----
Include the `omnibus::default` recipe in your node's run list and override the cookbook's default attributes as desired. At the very least you will want to override `node['omnibus']['install_dir']` to match the installation directory of your Omnibus project.
